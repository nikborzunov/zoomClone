## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project_folder>
2. Install the project dependencies:

Development
To run the application in development mode with live reloading:

Build the project (TypeScript compilation and Webpack bundling):

yarn build
Start the development server with Nodemon (watches for changes):

yarn devStart
Production
To run the built application in production mode, execute:

yarn start
Ngrok Setup
Use Ngrok to expose your local server over the internet for testing or demos:

Install Ngrok by following the instructions on the official website.

Launch Ngrok to tunnel your local server (default port 8080):

ngrok http 8080
Replace your localhost address with the provided Ngrok public URL.

Configuration
After starting Ngrok, update your PeerJS configuration with the new public URL. Edit src/modules/connection/peer.js and change the host value:

const peerOptions: PeerJSOption = {
    host: '<Your Ngrok Public URL>',
    port: 443,
    path: '/peerjs',
    secure: true,
    // ... other configuration options
};
Ensure necessary ports are open and adjust configurations for TypeScript, Webpack, and other tooling as needed.

Additional Information
Verify that the applicationâ€™s network ports are accessible.
When using Ngrok, ensure secure data transmission by utilizing appropriate encryption protocols.
Customize project settings to fit your development or production environment if required.
