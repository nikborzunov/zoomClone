# Zoom Clone

This project is a Zoom clone that includes the use of PeerJS and Socket.IO for real-time video chats.

## Installation

### Requirements

- Node.js (version 16 or later is recommended)
- Yarn (installed globally)
- Ngrok (for public tunnels)

### Installing Dependencies

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository>
    cd <project_folder>
    ```

2. Install the dependencies using Yarn.

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Running the Project

### Build

To build the project, run the following command:

```bash
yarn build
```

This command will run the TypeScript compilation and Webpack build for the client files.

### Running in Development Mode

For development, use the following command:

```bash
yarn devStart
```

This command will start the server using Nodemon and will also watch for code changes thanks to `tsc` and Webpack in watch mode.

### Running in Production Mode

To start the built application, use:

```bash
yarn start
```

### Connecting Ngrok

To make the project accessible over the internet, you need to configure Ngrok.

1. Install Ngrok (follow the instructions on the official website).
2. Run Ngrok to create a tunnel to your local server:

    ```bash
    ngrok http 8080
    ```

3. Use the provided public Ngrok URL during development and testing so that other users can connect to your application via the internet.

### Replacing the Ngrok URL

After starting Ngrok, update your PeerJS configuration to use the new public URL. Open `src/modules/connection/peer.js` and update the `host` to the new address.

```javascript
const peerOptions: PeerJSOption = {
    host: '<Your Ngrok URL>',
    port: 443,
    path: '/peerjs',
    secure: true,
    ...
};
```

## Additional Information

- Ensure that the ports used by the application are open and accessible.
- When using Ngrok, pay attention to security considerations (for example, avoid transmitting sensitive data without encryption).
- Adapt the configuration of TypeScript, Webpack, and other tools to your needs if necessary.
